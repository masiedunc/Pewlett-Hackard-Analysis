# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Progject
To prepare for the future of the company, Pewlett-Hackard (PH), requested an analysis, using PostgreSQL, of current retiring employees and employees eligible for retirement. After our initial analysis, we found that there is an exponentially high number of employees retiring, which promoted PH to consider building a mentorship program for new employees. To compile a list of eligible employees for the Mentorship Program, tables were created to organize and identify these employees.  

## Results
Major points of the analysis:
- After finding the count of employees per position that are retiring, the findings, in Image 1, show that the Senior Engineers and Senior Staff positions have the highest number of retirements. Interestingly, there were only 2 managers retiring.

- If we look at the Mentorship program, the findings, in Image 2, show that there are currently 1549 employees who are eligible to be mentors.

## Summary
As Pewlett-Hackard prepares for what they call a “silver tsunami,” the analysis identified 72,461 employees that are retiring. It’s important to note that 50,842 of the retiring employees hold positions as Senior Engineers and the Senior Staff, and these positions may need to take priority when moving forward with the Mentorship program. 
As noted above, there are 1549 eligible mentors. Based on employee data collected there do not seem to be enough mentors to cover all new employees. However, as stated above, considerations for areas that will be impacted the most, Senior Engineers and the Senior Staff, the efforts and resources could be directed there at the beginning of establishing this program. 
I believe more queries can be conducted to dive deeper into the overall impact of the “silver tsunami.” If able to identify the specific ratios of mentors to new employees per department, the Mentorship Program has the potential to be molded in a way that is beneficial to new employees and mentors. It is also possible that not all mentors will be needed or in demand at one time. Depending on the dates of retirement, mentors and new employees could roll out mentorship periods that align more closely with the onboarding of new employees.
