# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Progject
To prepare for the future of the company, Pewlett-Hackard (PH), requested an analysis, using PostgreSQL, of current retiring employees and employees eligible for retirement. After our initial analysis, we found that there is an exponentially high number of employees retiring, which promoted PH to consider building a mentorship program for new employees. To compile a list of eligible employees for the Mentorship Program, tables were created to organize and identify these employees.  

## Results
Major points of the analysis:
- After finding the count of employees per position that are retiring, the findings, in Image 1, show that the Senior Engineers and Senior Staff positions have the highest number of retirements. Interestingly, there were only 2 managers retiring.
